Благодаря использованию супер-быстрого интерфейса PCIe Gen3x4, накопитель SX8000 достигает экстремально высоких скоростей вплоть до 2 500 / 1 100 Мб в секунду (чтение/запись), что фактически превосходит скорость жесткого диска SATA 6Gb/s в несколько раз! Имея спецификацию NVMe 1.2, накопитель SX8000 обеспечивает превосходные характеристики произвольного чтения/записи и возможность одновременного выполнения нескольких задач. Он оснащен флэш-памятью 3D NAND, которая обеспечивает высокую плотность и надежность хранения по сравнению с 2D NAND. Благодаря поддержке технологий SLC-кэширования, кэш-буфера DRAM и кода коррекции ошибок с контролем четности (LDPC ECC), накопитель SX8000 обеспечивает оптимизированную производительность и целостность данных даже в самых требовательных играх, при просмотре изображениях высокой четкости, при разгоне процессора или в других высокотребовательных приложениях.\r\rРазработанный для игр, разгона процессора и просмотра изображений высокой четкости, накопитель SX8000 идеально подходит для приложений, работа которых основана на высоких характеристиках хранения данных. Это идеальное решение для высокотехнологичных систем, благодаря супер-быстрому интерфейсу PCIe Gen3x4, обеспечивающему великолепные скорости чтения/записи до 2 500/1 100 Мб в секунду. Скорость чтения почти в четыре раз быстрее, чем у жесткого диска SATA 6Gb/s, а скорость записи — выше, чем в два раза. Компактный форм-фактор M.2 2280 позволяет пользователю с легкостью устанавливать накопитель SX8000 в игровых ноутбуках и ПК без необходимости использовать спутывающиеся кабели или специальные питающие провода. Накопитель SX8000 поддерживает самые последние платформы Intel, что позволяет игрокам и пользователям, интересующимся разгоном компьютера, использовать свою систему на полную мощность.\r\rБлагодаря универсальности флэш-памяти 3D NAND, SSD-накопитель SX8000 M.2 2280 имеет единый компактный форм-фактор и выпускается с различным объемом — от 128 Гб до 1 Тб. Более того, флэш-память 3D NAND превосходит по своим характеристикам 2D NAND и обеспечивает более высокую эффективность и надежность работы. Все модели накопителей SX8000 оснащены технологией высокого показателя TBW (суммарное число записываемых байтов), которая определяет, сколько раз можно выполнить перезапись всего объема SSD-накопителя в течение его срока службы. Показатель TBW у накопителя SX8000 выше, чем у сопоставимых моделей, что гарантирует более длительный срок эксплуатации SSD."], ["image_file_name", "data"], ["image_content_type", "image/jpeg"], ["image_file_size", 5333], ["image_updated_at", "2018-03-18 19:47:15.785439"], ["company_id", 42], ["price", 4274], ["volume", 128], ["size", "M.2"], ["write_speed", 550.0], ["read_speed", 1000.0], ["created_at", "2018-03-18 19:47:15.811013"], ["updated_at", "2018-03-18 19:47:15.811013"]]

Благодаря использованию супер-быстрого интерфейса PCIe Gen3x4, накопитель SX8000 достигает экстремально высоких скоростей вплоть до 2 500 / 1 100 Мб в секунду (чтение/запись), что фактически превосходит скорость жесткого диска SATA 6Gb/s в несколько раз! Имея спецификацию NVMe 1.2, накопитель SX8000 обеспечивает превосходные характеристики произвольного чтения/записи и возможность одновременного выполнения нескольких задач. Он оснащен флэш-памятью 3D NAND, которая обеспечивает высокую плотность и надежность хранения по сравнению с 2D NAND. Благодаря поддержке технологий SLC-кэширования, кэш-буфера DRAM и кода коррекции ошибок с контролем четности (LDPC ECC), накопитель SX8000 обеспечивает оптимизированную производительность и целостность данных даже в самых требовательных играх, при просмотре изображениях высокой четкости, при разгоне процессора или в других высокотребовательных приложениях.\r\rРазработанный для игр, разгона процессора и просмотра изображений высокой четкости, накопитель SX8000 идеально подходит для приложений, работа которых основана на высоких характеристиках хранения данных. Это идеальное решение для высокотехнологичных систем, благодаря супер-быстрому интерфейсу PCIe Gen3x4, обеспечивающему великолепные скорости чтения/записи до 2 500/1 100 Мб в секунду. Скорость чтения почти в четыре раз быстрее, чем у жесткого диска SATA 6Gb/s, а скорость записи — выше, чем в два раза. Компактный форм-фактор M.2 2280 позволяет пользователю с легкостью устанавливать накопитель SX8000 в игровых ноутбуках и ПК без необходимости использовать спутывающиеся кабели или специальные питающие провода. Накопитель SX8000 поддерживает самые последние платформы Intel, что позволяет игрокам и пользователям, интересующимся разгоном компьютера, использовать свою систему на полную мощность.\r\rБлагодаря универсальности флэш-памяти 3D NAND, SSD-накопитель SX8000 M.2 2280 имеет единый компактный форм-фактор и выпускается с различным объемом — от 128 Гб до 1 Тб. Более того, флэш-память 3D NAND превосходит по своим характеристикам 2D NAND и обеспечивает более высокую эффективность и надежность работы. Все модели накопителей SX8000 оснащены технологией высокого показателя TBW (суммарное число записываемых байтов), которая определяет, сколько раз можно выполнить перезапись всего объема SSD-накопителя в течение его срока службы. Показатель TBW у накопителя SX8000 выше, чем у сопоставимых моделей, что гарантирует более длительный срок эксплуатации SSD."], ["image_file_name", "data"], ["image_content_type", "image/jpeg"], ["image_file_size", 5333], ["image_updated_at", "2018-05-11 15:15:15.404623"], ["company_id", 18], ["price", 4274], ["volume", 128], ["size", "M.2"], ["write_speed", 550.0], ["read_speed", 1000.0], ["created_at", "2018-05-11 15:15:15.455985"], ["updated_at", "2018-05-11 15:15:15.455985"]]

Благодаря использованию супер-быстрого интерфейса PCIe Gen3x4, накопитель SX8000 достигает экстремально высоких скоростей вплоть до 2 500 / 1 100 Мб в секунду (чтение/запись), что фактически превосходит скорость жесткого диска SATA 6Gb/s в несколько раз! Имея спецификацию NVMe 1.2, накопитель SX8000 обеспечивает превосходные характеристики произвольного чтения/записи и возможность одновременного выполнения нескольких задач. Он оснащен флэш-памятью 3D NAND, которая обеспечивает высокую плотность и надежность хранения по сравнению с 2D NAND. Благодаря поддержке технологий SLC-кэширования, кэш-буфера DRAM и кода коррекции ошибок с контролем четности (LDPC ECC), накопитель SX8000 обеспечивает оптимизированную производительность и целостность данных даже в самых требовательных играх, при просмотре изображениях высокой четкости, при разгоне процессора или в других высокотребовательных приложениях.\r\rРазработанный для игр, разгона процессора и просмотра изображений высокой четкости, накопитель SX8000 идеально подходит для приложений, работа которых основана на высоких характеристиках хранения данных. Это идеальное решение для высокотехнологичных систем, благодаря супер-быстрому интерфейсу PCIe Gen3x4, обеспечивающему великолепные скорости чтения/записи до 2 500/1 100 Мб в секунду. Скорость чтения почти в четыре раз быстрее, чем у жесткого диска SATA 6Gb/s, а скорость записи — выше, чем в два раза. Компактный форм-фактор M.2 2280 позволяет пользователю с легкостью устанавливать накопитель SX8000 в игровых ноутбуках и ПК без необходимости использовать спутывающиеся кабели или специальные питающие провода. Накопитель SX8000 поддерживает самые последние платформы Intel, что позволяет игрокам и пользователям, интересующимся разгоном компьютера, использовать свою систему на полную мощность.\r\rБлагодаря универсальности флэш-памяти 3D NAND, SSD-накопитель SX8000 M.2 2280 имеет единый компактный форм-фактор и выпускается с различным объемом — от 128 Гб до 1 Тб. Более того, флэш-память 3D NAND превосходит по своим характеристикам 2D NAND и обеспечивает более высокую эффективность и надежность работы. Все модели накопителей SX8000 оснащены технологией высокого показателя TBW (суммарное число записываемых байтов), которая определяет, сколько раз можно выполнить перезапись всего объема SSD-накопителя в течение его срока службы. Показатель TBW у накопителя SX8000 выше, чем у сопоставимых моделей, что гарантирует более длительный срок эксплуатации SSD."], ["image_file_name", "data"], ["image_content_type", "image/jpeg"], ["image_file_size", 5333], ["image_updated_at", "2018-05-11 15:35:31.148020"], ["company_id", 18], ["price", 4274], ["volume", 128], ["size", "M.2"], ["write_speed", 550.0], ["read_speed", 1000.0], ["created_at", "2018-05-11 15:35:31.200850"], ["updated_at", "2018-05-11 15:35:31.200850"]]
